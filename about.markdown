I am a doctoral student in Computer Science entering my third year at Rutgers University–New Brunswick, under the guidance of Professor [Konstantinos Michmizos](http://combra.cs.rutgers.edu/). My primary areas of research focus include Brain-inspired Computation and Medical Imaging Informatics. I have expertise in addressing few-shot learning challenges within the medical domain. Presently, my efforts are dedicated to the real-time analysis of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data and the exploration of spiking neural networks.
